# 🧠 Brain-Tumor-Detection-from-MRI

### Project Overview
This project implements a U-Net architecture with a ResNet34 encoder to perform semantic segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans. The model is trained on 2D slices extracted from the BraTS 2020 dataset (converted to .h5 format for faster loading) and achieves pixel-wise tumor detection with interpretable visualisations.

------------
### Model Architecture
- Backbone: ResNet34 (ImageNet pretrained)
- Segmentation head: U-Net
•Loss Function: Combined Dice Loss + CrossEntropyLoss
•Framework: PyTorch + segmentation-models-pytorch
•Precision: Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) for faster training on T4 GPUs

----------
### Performance
•Dice Coefficient: ~0.80 (on validation set)
•IoU Score: ~0.70
•Visual output includes MRI, true mask, predicted mask, and overlay
•Includes automated radiology-style interpretation reports
